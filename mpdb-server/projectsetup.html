<h1>MetPetDB Introduction</h1>
<p>Welcome to the MetPetDB project. This guide serves as a
step-by-step instruction manual on joining the MetPetDB team. After
reading this manual, you will hopefully have everything on your machine
and ready to run, as well as a decent understanding of the project as a
whole.</p>

<h2>MetPetDB Start-Up Guide</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Development Tools
	<p>IMPORTANT: On windows machines, avoid spaces like the plague. Do
	not place any of these tools in a file path that has spaces. So
	installing to My Documents or Program Files is bad. While some of these
	may work fine under these circumstances, it will save a lot of grief if
	you just avoid it.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>PostgreSQL (Version 8.1.x or 8.2.x seem to work) The SQL
		database behind MetPetDB is PostgreSQL. The database software can be
		acquired at: http://www.postgresql.org/ Install the server according
		to the documented guidelines for your platform. However, do not check
		the box to install PostGIS as that will be done separately. Be sure to
		keep the password and username you provide in a readily accessible
		location as you will need this data again at a later time. Throughout
		the installation, use the default settings.</li>
		<li>PostGIS To enable spatial operators (for geopositioning)
		MetPetDB uses the PostGIS database extension. The database software
		can be acquired at: http://www.postgis.org/ The PostGIS installation
		procedure is fairly well documented in the PostGIS documentation
		itself . During the installation process, you will be given the chance
		to create a database, but you don’t have to worry about this stuff.
		We’ve got that covered, so just hang tight!</li>
		<li>(Optional) Apache Tomcat To run the MetPetDB server-side
		components, Java Servlets are used. To make use of these, Apache
		Tomcat 5.5.x is needed, which can be found below:
		http://tomcat.apache.org/ Standard tomcat installation instructions
		should be followed for your platform. It is usually just a matter of
		downloading the binary distribution and expanding it to a directory on
		your drive.</li>
		<li>(Optional, Eclipse includes a built in ant) Apache Ant The
		MetPetDB build scripts use Apache Ant. It can be found at:

		http://ant.apache.org/ Ant installation is just a matter of
		decompressing the binary distribution and adding the bin/ subdirectory
		to your PATH. To do this on a windows machine, right click My Computer
		and traverse the following. My
		Computer->Properties->Advanced->Environment Variables Under System
		Variables, click Path. Select edit and then add a semi-colon and the
		address of the ant bin.</li>
		<li>Java Development Kit NOTE: You do not need Java EE SDK,
		NetBeans, or JRE. A 1.5.x or later JDK is required to compile
		MetPetDB. A JRE is NOT sufficient for compiliation, as it does not
		include the Java compiler. To be sure you have the JDK, a folder
		should be created on your system that is named "jdk(Version#)". It can
		be downloaded at: http://java.sun.com/ On Windows, when you have
		installed Java Development Kit, return to the Environment Variables
		screen. 1. Under user variables, change PATH to be the address of the
		bin in the jdk. 2. In addition, create a new variable JAVA_HOME as a
		system variable and give it the address of the jdk folder. 3. Under
		Path in System Variables, add %JAVA_HOME%\bin.</li>
		<li>Google Web Toolkit The MetPetDB client side components must
		be translated from Java source code to HTML+JavaScript before they can
		be utilized by a browser. This translator is built into GWT which can
		be downloaded from: http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/ Download
		version 1.4.61. Installation of GWT is a simple matter of expanding
		the binary distribution for your platform into a directory. (Currently
		GWT is located in the repository under the directory mpdb-common/gwt)</li>
		<li>Eclipse (version 3.3x and up) Download eclipse IDE for java
		development at: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ Subclipse is
		necessary in order to use eclipse’s source control. Found at:
		http://subclipse.tigris.org/download.html installation guide:
		http://subclipse.tigris.org/install.html</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Setting Up The Project
	<ul>
		<li>With Eclipse open go to Window->Open Perspective->Other...
		and select SVN Repository Exploring</li>
		<li>Right click on the Left Pane (SVN Repository) and go to
		New->Repository Location
		<ul>
			<li>Url is svn+ssh://mary-kate.cs.rpi.edu/projects/metpetdb/svn
			[mary-kate.cs.rpi.edu could also be replaced with any other CS server
			i.e. monica.cs.rpi.edu, ashley.cs.rpi.edu]</li>
			<li>If you have problems see
			http://subclipse.tigris.org/faq.html</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The repository location will show up in the Left Pane</li>
		<li>Expand the newly create repository location, and also expand
		the trunk directory</li>
		<li>Right click on mpdb-client and select Checkout...</li>
		<li>Keep the default settings and click Finish</li>
		<li>Repeat steps e and f for mpdb-common and mpdb-server</li>
		<li>Switch back to the Java perspective (Window->Open
		Perspective->Other... and select Java (Default))</li>
		<li>You will see three newly created Projects (mpdb-client,
		mpdb-common, and mpdb-server) they will all have approximately
		infinity+1 errors</li>
		<li>Expand the Project mpdb-common</li>
		<li>Create a new document in the root of the project named
		build.properties</li>
		<li>Add to build.properties the following:<br />
		gwt_home=[your path to gwt]<br />
		postgis=[your path to postgis]<br />
		DATABASE=[name you want the database to be] <br />
		APPUSER=[name of the user you want for the database] <br />
		APPPASS=[password of the above user] <br />
		<br />
		As an example:<br />
		gwt_home=/home/anthony/development/gwt-linux<br />
		postgis=/usr/share/postgresql-8.2-postgis<br />
		DATABASE=mpdb_watera2<br />
		APPUSER=metpetwebtst <br />
		APPPASS=</li>
		<li>Right click on build.xml and select Run As->Ant Build...</li>
		<li>Under Targets select all-eclipse and click Run</li>
		<li>This will generate the appropriate .classpath file for each
		of the projects</li>
		<li>Right click on each of the projects and select Refresh</li>
		<li>All of the errors for the projects will magically disappear</li>
		<li>Setting up the .property files
		<p>Under the directory mpdb-server/src there are several .property
		files that need to be created in order for the application to work,
		they are
		<ul>
			<li>files.properties
			<p>This properties file contains the paths to where upload files
			are stored and it should contain the following: (see files.properties.base)</p>
			<p>fileUpload.path=/full/path/to/store/uploaded_files/<br />
			images.path=/full/path/to/store/uploaded_images/</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Database Initialization
	<p>NOTE: For this initialization to work properly, you must have
	the files "lwpostgis.sql" and "spatial_ref_sys.sql" in the directory
	specified by postgis = during eclipse set-up.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Start up psql (POSIX users can type the command in the
		terminal, Windows users can go to Start->Programs->PostgreSql->psql)</li>
		<li>Enter the password for the account you created when you
		installed PostgreSQL</li>
		<li>Change directory to mpdb-server/build/schema, An example of
		this is \cd C:/workspace/mpdb-server/build/schema</li>
		<li>Execute "\i recreate-database.sql"</li>
	</ul>

	</li>
	<li>Running the Project
	<ul>
		<li>In eclipse, Go to Run->Open Run Dialog...</li>
		<li>Select mpdb-server under Java Application and click Run</li>
		<li>Select mpdb-client under Java Application and click Run
		MetPetDB</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>General Practices</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Source Control (Keeping the code up-to-date)
	<ul>
		<li>Getting the latest code
		<ul>
			<li>In eclipse, right click on the project name</li>
			<li>Select Team ->Synchronize With Repository. This will bring
			up the Synchronize Perspective.</li>
			<li>On this page, right click the project name and select
			Synchronize</li>
			<li>This will show you the changes that have occurred in the
			source code, it will not update the code nor commit any of your
			changes you need to choose the Update... option to do that.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Committing the Code
		<ul>
			<li>In eclipse, right click on the project name. Select Team
			->Commit</li>
			<li>This will bring up a view with check boxes next to the files
			you have modified</li>
			<li>Place a comment in the top box describing the changes you
			made.</li>
			<li>Click OK to commit the changes.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
