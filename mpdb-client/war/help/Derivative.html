<h1 id="DerivativeData">Derivative Data</h1>
<p>
There are many types of derivative data that we would like to include in the database, because these may be of tremendous value to non-petrologists who wish to learn what is available from our science. For example, a structural geologist working in an area may be interested in the P-T conditions that are constrained by the petrology. He or she may not wish to examine the raw data, but only the resulting P-T calculations. While we know that this approach is fraught with innumerable pitfalls, we envision a system where the data would be presented with a sense of its uncertainty so that unwise use could be kept to a minimum.

<p>
Details of how derivative data should be handled are in discussion at this point in the project.
