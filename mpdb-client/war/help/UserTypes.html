<p>
Members will be asked the following information:
</p>
<ul><li>(verified) email (also used as username), 
</li><li>(required) firstname, lastname, password, 
</li><li>(optional) affiliation (see also <a class="wiki" href="InterfaceDesign/Registration">registration wireframes</a>).
</li></ul><h3 id="AccessRights1">Access Rights</h3>
<ul><li>Members can do everything an Anonymous user can do.
</li><li>Members can download any public data sets using one of the available formats.
</li><li>Members cannot upload any new data to the system. 
</li><li>Members cannot comment on existing data either public or private.

<ul><li>(required) affiliation
</li><li>address
</li><li>description of interests (short text with a description of research including past publications)
</li><li>sponsor (username of another member of the metpetdb system who will verify the membership)
</li></ul><p>
The Contributor will be asked to look up an existing <a class="wiki" href="UserTypes.html#Fellow">Fellow</a> in their field of study from the database and designate this person as their sponsor. Upon registration, the system shall send a mail to the sponsor together with the name, affiliation, address, description of interests of the new user. The sponsor will then have the option of accepting/denying the membership of the new user. Upon acceptance, the new user will be notified by email and will become a Contributor.
</p>
<p>
Students with no existing research publications will be asked to contact a faculty member active in the area and ask them to become members of the system first. These faculty members can then sponsor their research.
</p>
<p>
The system shall keep track of the sponsor for each user and will use this information if necessary to track problems.
</p>
<p>

</li><li>unlock a previously locked user account.  Unlocking a user account requires supplying a reason for the unlock, viewable by all other Fellows.
</li><li>make changes to published data with comments describing the reason for the change.
</li><li>revoke Fellow rights from a Fellow, knocking them down to Contributor.
</li></ul><p>

</p>
<ul><li>change ownership of private data to another Contributor.
</li></ul><p>
Metpetdb admins cannot see and modify the private data of other users.
