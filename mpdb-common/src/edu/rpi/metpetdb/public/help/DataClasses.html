<h1 id="DataClassification">Data Classification</h1>
<h2 id="MPDBwillcontaintwomainbranchesofdata:">MPDB will contain two main "branches" of data:</h2>
<p>
<strong>1. The working data branch</strong>
</p>
<ul><li>These are owned data, which will be entered under the "working data" umbrella, and be available for sharing and editing by collaborators within a project.  These data can be changed only by the owner or a <a class="wiki" href="Projects.html">project member</a> with specific privileges.
</li><li>The owner may specify which data (samples, subsamples, analyses) are to be 
<ul><li><a class="wiki" href="DataClasses.html#PrivateData">Private data</a> - viewable only by the owner (or a <a class="wiki" href="Projects.html">project member</a> when these data are included in a project).
</li><li><a class="wiki" href="DataClasses.html#PublicData">Public data</a> - viewable by anyone
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
<strong>2. The published data branch</strong>
</p>
<ul><li><a class="wiki" href="PublishedData.html">Published data</a> appear in the database as public data with the owner "Published".
</li></ul><ul><li>These data are added to MetPetDB in two possible ways:
<ul><li>Extraction from peer-reviewed, published manuscripts. See below.
</li><li>Added during <a class="wiki" href="PublicationOfData.html">publication of data that were already part of MetPetDB</a>. This process results in a "published" copy of the data.
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
<br />
<br />
</p>
<h1 id="DataAccess">Data Access</h1>
<h2 id="PrivateData">Private Data</h2>
<p>
Private data are only searchable/viewable/downloadable by designated users.  The data owner designates who these users are by inviting them to join his/her <a class="wiki" href="Projects.html">project</a>.
</p>
<p>
Private data can be made public only by the data owner.  Once data has been made public it can be viewed by anyone.
</p>
<p>
All samples, subsamples and chemical analyses can be designated as either public or private.
</p>
<p>
Users make private data public as follows:
</p>
<ul><li>Only the owner can make his/her data public.
</li><li>A chemical analysis can be made public only if its subsample is public.
</li><li>A subsample can be made public only if its sample is public
</li><li>Images associated with a sample are made public with that sample
</li><li>Images associated with a specific subsample are made public only with that subsample.
</li><li>An image map can be made public only if its parts (subsamples, chemical analyses) are public.
</li></ul><ul><li>All of
<ul><li>a sample or group of samples and their corresponding data
</li><li>a subsample or group of subsamples and their corresponding data
</li><li>a chemical analysis or group of analyses and their corresponding data
</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote>
<p>
...may be made public using the <a class="wiki" href="HowToMakePublic.html">make public</a> routine.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<h2 id="PublicData">Public Data</h2>
<p>
Public data are searchable/viewable by any user and downloadable by any member user.
</p>
<p>
Public data can only be modified or deleted by:
</p>
<ul><li>The owner
</li><li>A project member with <a class="wiki" href="Projects.html#SpecialAccess">read/write privileges</a>
</li><li>MetPedDB Admin under special circumstances
</li></ul><p>
Multiple public versions of a subsample image map may exist. Each version is assumed to be an improved/expanded version of the previous version.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Users should note that public data may be changed at any time and MetPetDB recommends that non-owners using public data should download that data, creating a "static" copy.</strong>
